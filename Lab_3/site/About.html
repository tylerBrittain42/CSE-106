      <h4 class="center">Written by Rick Remender</h4>
      <p> &emsp; Deadly Class focuses on Marcus, a homeless youth with a vendetta against both clowns and the president.
          A chance opportunity allows him to attend King's Dominion, a school for assassins, that promises to teach him the skills
          to finally make a change in the world. As Marcus adjusts to life in a unique school he begins to question the promises that enticed him.
          Perhaps King's Dominion does not intend to bring change, perhaps it is protecting the status quo that it claims to change.
